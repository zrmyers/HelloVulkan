# HelloVulkan
Visual Studio Project utilizing Vulkan API

# Introduction

The purpose of this project is to get familiar with the Vulkan API, as well as to establish a reusable class (wrappper) for interacting
with the GPU in future projects.

This project was developed with insight gleaned from "API Without Secrets" tutorial series by Pawel L. on Intel's devleoper zone, to which a link is provided below.  The vulkan specification document is also a handy tool.
